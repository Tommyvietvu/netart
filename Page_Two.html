  <h1>THE LORD OF THE RING-PART ONE: THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING QUOTES</h1>

  <p>All that is gold does not glitter,
    Not all those who wander are lost;
    <br>
    The old that is strong does not wither,
    Deep roots are not reached by the frost.
    <br>
    From the ashes a fire shall be woken,
    A light from the shadows shall spring;
    <br>
    Renewed shall be blade that was broken,
    The crownless again shall be king.</p>
